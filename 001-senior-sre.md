# Senior Site Reliability Engineer (001)

**Location:** Remote (North America preferred)

## About the Role

We're looking for a Senior SRE to own the reliability, scalability, and operational excellence of our infrastructure. You'll work across the stack, from Kubernetes clusters to application observability, ensuring our systems are resilient and our engineers are saved from needless toil.

## What You'll Do

* Design, build, and maintain our GKE-based infrastructure on GCP
* Own our GitOps workflows using Flux and the Flux Operator
* Build and improve our observability pipeline (OpenTelemetry Collector, tracing-first approach)
* Collaborate with backend engineers on schema-driven services (Golang, entgo.io, PostgreSQL)
* Debug and resolve issues across the stack, including frontend integration points (ConnectRPC, Next.js)
* Drive incident response and build systems that prevent incidents in the first place

## What You Bring

* 5+ years in SRE, DevOps, or platform engineering roles
* Deep experience with Kubernetes (GKE preferred) and container orchestration
* Strong Golang skills; you can read and contribute to application code
* Hands-on experience with GitOps (Flux, ArgoCD, or similar)
* Familiarity with gRPC/Protobuf ecosystems (ConnectRPC a plus)
* Solid understanding of PostgreSQL operations
* GitHub Actions and CI/CD pipeline design
* Exposure to GraphQL APIs helpful

## Who You Are

* Proactive problem-solver who identifies issues before they become incidents
* Excellent async communicator—clear, concise, written-first
* Comfortable with ambiguity; you know how to get things to "done"
* High agency—you take ownership and drive outcomes
* Schema-driven thinker who values declarative, reproducible systems
