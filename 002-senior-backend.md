# Senior Backend Engineer (002)

**Location:** Remote (North America preferred)

## About the Role

We're looking for a Senior Backend Engineer to build and maintain our Golang-based API layer. You'll own services end-to-end—from schema design through production—working with a modern, type-safe stack that prioritizes correctness and developer experience.

## Our Stack

Golang, ConnectRPC, Protobuf (Buf), entgo.io, PostgreSQL, Atlas migrations, River Queue. Backend for Frontend (BFF) layer in TypeScript/Next.js on Vercel. Auth via WorkOS. Some GraphQL.

## What You'll Do

* Design and ship API contracts that frontend and other services depend on
* Own features from schema design through deployment
* Improve and maintain application architecture as the codebase grows
* Debug across service boundaries when things break
* Write code that other engineers want to work in
* Drive technical decisions and document them clearly
* Review code with an eye toward long-term maintainability

## What You Bring

* 5+ years backend engineering, strong Golang proficiency
* Opinions on Golang project structure and architecture patterns
* Deep PostgreSQL experience—schema design, migrations, query tuning
* Hands-on with gRPC/Protobuf ecosystems
* Enough TypeScript/Next.js to debug and extend BFF layers
* Experience with background job systems
* Appreciation for schema-driven development and type-safe contracts

## Who You Are

* Proactive problem-solver who identifies issues before they become incidents
* Excellent async communicator—clear, concise, written-first
* Comfortable with ambiguity; you know how to get things to "done"
* High agency—you take ownership and drive outcomes
* Schema-driven thinker who values declarative, reproducible systems
